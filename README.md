# CPFA (Climate Prediction For All)

## Introduction
CPFA is an open-source project designed to help undergraduate students and non-experts
easily analyze and visualize climate prediction data using the **Pangu-Weather** model.
The goal is to simplify complex datasets and make climate prediction more accessible
for learning and research.

## Features
- **Model Loading** — Load the pretrained Pangu-Weather ONNX model.  
- **Data Handling** — Load and preprocess datasets (e.g., surface temperature, latitude, longitude, and time).  
- **Prediction** — Run model inference to generate prediction results.  
- **Visualization** — Display predicted surface temperature on a world map using Cartopy.  

> *(Planned features such as Regional Comparison and Statistical Summary will be added in future releases.)*

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hyeok719/CPFA.git
   cd CPFA
