# ✨ Features

The CPFA project provides the following features:

## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

- Automatic download of climate reanalysis datasets such as ERA5

- Domain slicing for regions of interest (e.g., East Asia, Korean Peninsula)

- Conversion into formats suitable for prediction and analysis (NetCDF, NPY, etc.)

## 2. Climate Prediction with Pangu-Weather

- Short-term prediction using the pretrained Pangu-Weather model

- Supports forecasting multiple meteorological variables

## 3. Visualization Tools

- Visualization of prediction outputs using map projections (e.g., PlateCarree)

- Variable-specific plots such as temperature, precipitation, and wind vectors

- Comparison plots between observations and predictions

## 4. Model Performance Evaluation

- Calculation of core statistical metrics (RMSE, MAE, Correlation, etc.)

- Example analyses for temporal and spatial performance

- Exportable figures and tables suitable for academic reports or publications
