# Contributing to CPFA (Climate Prediction For All)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **CPFA**!  
Our goal is to make climate prediction and visualization easier for students and non-experts.

## How to Contribute
### ✔ 1) Check the Feature Requests Hub and submit a Pull Request
Browse the Feature Requests Hub or open issues to find something you’d like to work on.
If you need development guidelines, refer to the Development Guide, or feel free to ask questions in GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.

### ✔ 2) Contribute to the test suite
More tests mean higher reliability.
If you enjoy improving software quality, contributing test cases is a great way to help strengthen CPFA.

### ✔ 3) Improve the documentation
Clear documentation makes CPFA easier for everyone to understand and use.
This includes README updates, tutorials, API explanations, and troubleshooting guides.

### ✔ 4) Add new examples
If you built something cool with CPFA, please share it!
Example notebooks, demo scripts, and visualizations help others learn faster.

### ✔ 5) Share your story and experience
If CPFA supported your research project, climate-data analysis, or data-visualization competition, let us know.
We’d love to feature real user stories to inspire others.

### ✔ 6) Found a bug or have a feature idea?
Open an Issue or submit a Pull Request at any time.
Bug reports, improvements, questions, and suggestions are all welcome.

### ✔ 7) Branching Model  
The main branch is protected for code stability.  
All feature development must be done in short-lived feature branches.  
Direct commits to main are not allowed. All changes must be merged through a Pull Request (PR).

### ✔ 8) Pull Request Management (PR hygiene)  
Link the related Issue when creating a PR (e.g., “Closes #12”).  
Request at least one reviewer before merging.  
Ensure that all automated checks (tests, lint, CI workflows) pass before merging.

## Running Tests

```python
pytest
```



We appreciate your contributions to make **CPFA** better for everyone!
