## Project Overview
An open-source project designed to make climate prediction models and complex meteorological data easy to use for undergraduate students and non-experts.

CPFA aims to provide:

- ✅ Simple installation and execution on Windows environments

- ✅ A complete climate-prediction pipeline based on Pangu-Weather

- ✅ Easy visualization of prediction outputs

- ✅ A structured model performance evaluation guideline comparing predictions with real observations

## Why CPFA?

Existing deep-learning climate models often suffer from:

Complicated data preprocessing steps

Difficult environment setup (libraries, GPUs, dependencies)

Lack of a clear and systematic framework for performance evaluation

To address these challenges, CPFA aims to deliver:

“A climate prediction and evaluation guideline that anyone can follow quickly and easily.”

# ✨ Features

The CPFA project provides the following features:

## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

- Automatic download of climate reanalysis datasets such as ERA5

- Domain slicing for regions of interest (e.g., East Asia, Korean Peninsula)

- Conversion into formats suitable for prediction and analysis (NetCDF, NPY, etc.)

## 2. Climate Prediction with Pangu-Weather

- Short-term prediction using the pretrained Pangu-Weather model

- Supports forecasting multiple meteorological variables

## 3. Visualization Tools

- Visualization of prediction outputs using map projections (e.g., PlateCarree)

- Variable-specific plots such as temperature, precipitation, and wind vectors

- Comparison plots between observations and predictions

## 4. Model Performance Evaluation

- Calculation of core statistical metrics (RMSE, MAE, Correlation, etc.)

- Example analyses for temporal and spatial performance

- Exportable figures and tables suitable for academic reports or publications
