## Project Overview
An open-source project designed to make climate prediction models and complex meteorological data easy to use for undergraduate students and non-experts.

CPFA aims to provide:

- ✅ Simple installation and execution on Windows environments

- ✅ A complete climate-prediction pipeline based on Pangu-Weather

- ✅ Easy visualization of prediction outputs

- ✅ A structured model performance evaluation guideline comparing predictions with real observations

## Why CPFA?

Existing deep-learning climate models often suffer from:

Complicated data preprocessing steps

Difficult environment setup (libraries, GPUs, dependencies)

Lack of a clear and systematic framework for performance evaluation

To address these challenges, CPFA aims to deliver:

“A climate prediction and evaluation guideline that anyone can follow quickly and easily.”
